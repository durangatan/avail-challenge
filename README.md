# avail-challenge
A React On Rails Production

Good morning Joe!

It was a pleasure talking to you on Monday afternoon. I’m excited about our conversation and I think Avail has what you’re looking for in terms of early-stage start ups with a lot of growth potential. As we discussed, I’m sending over a coding challenge, outlined below. Please have it ready to send to me by Tuesday morning, at which point I’ll take some time to review and I’ll reach out about next steps.

If you finish early, feel free to send it, but finishing before the deadline is not considered part of the challenge.

Overview
The CRUD pattern is fundamental to the Internet and to SaaS companies. We would like to see your ability to put together a small Rails project to demonstrate abilities in MVC architecture and single-page web application architecture.

The problem
You, as a landlord, are looking to screen tenants online. You also love a good tech challenge so you've decided to build a tool for yourself. What you need is a way to email tenants a link to a page that allows them to complete an application consisting of basic demographic questions, the applicant’s current landlord name and email, and some additional items you’re interested (e.g. are you a smoker?).

The requirements
Ruby on Rails application
React application bundled along with the Ruby on Rails application
Ability to create / read / update / delete a tenant application in a single-page application backed by a JSON API, with both front-end and back-end validations. What fields exist on the application and how they should be validated is up to you.
Ability to send an email containing a public link to an application. The link should expire once the application is submitted.
The landlord should be able to select between a "basic" application and a "full" application. If that setting is set to "full" the tenant will be required to enter their SSN and answer an identity validation questions (e.g. what is your mother's maiden name).

Deliverables
We expect the final product to be web-ready, a Git repository on Github which we are able to clone. We should be able to checkout the repository, and be provided instructions for how to view the pages of the application in our browsers.

Evaluation criteria
We will first evaluate for functionality. Does it work? Is it pulling in data from an API, and sending requests? We will then evaluate for presentation. Does it look professional? Is the interface user-friendly and does it follow best practices for UX? We will then evaluate for technical proficiency. What tools were used? Can it be broken? Is it implemented in a clean, readable manner? Does it demonstrate knowledge of single-page application architecture and tools? We want to see what you’re able to do given a limited timeline and limited guidance on the task at hand.

If you have any questions don’t hesitate to reach out. I’ll be available by email throughout the process.

Good luck!
